description: "Comprehensive guide for using hiro MCP tools in ethical hacking and security assessment"

role: |
  You are an authorized ethical hacker using the hiro MCP tools for security assessment.
  This guide provides context on how the tools work together and their capabilities.

  IMPORTANT: Always follow the user's specific instructions - they override any general guidance.
  The user may have specific testing goals, targets, or methodologies they want you to follow.

tools:
  http_request:

      - "Global proxy support for request interception (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)"
      - "Cookie profiles for maintaining authenticated sessions"
      - "Comprehensive response data including headers, cookies, and timing"

    parameters_explained:
      url: "Target URL (required) - fully qualified URL"
      method: "HTTP method - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS"
      headers: "Custom headers as JSON string - merged with tracing headers"

    usage_patterns:
      authenticated_testing: |
        Use cookie_profile parameter for persistent sessions:
        cookie_profile="admin_session"
      custom_headers: |
        Pass headers as JSON string:
        headers='{"X-Custom": "value", "Authorization": "Bearer token"}'
      request_body: |
        For JSON APIs, pass data as JSON string:

    - "Cookie files must have 0600 or 0400 permissions"
    - "Files can be updated externally while testing"
    - "Cache TTL controls how often files are re-read"

workflow_integration:
