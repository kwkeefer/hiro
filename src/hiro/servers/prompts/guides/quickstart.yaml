quick_start_workflow: |
  1. Create target (entire API/system)
  2. Create mission (specific goal)
  3. Make HTTP requests (auto-logged)
  4. Record actions (what you learned)
  5. Use vector search for similar techniques

essential_examples:
  complete_workflow: |
    # 1. Define target scope
    target = create_target(
      name="Example API",
      base_url="https://api.example.com"
    )

    # 2. Start focused mission
    mission = create_mission(
      target_id=target["id"],
      mission_type="auth_bypass",
      name="Test JWT validation",
      goal="Bypass authentication"
    )

    # 3. Test (HTTP requests auto-link to mission)
    response = http_request(
      url="https://api.example.com/admin",
      headers='{"Authorization": "Bearer [modified-jwt]"}'
    )

    # 4. Record what you learned
    record_action(
      mission_id=mission["id"],
      technique="JWT alg:none bypass",
      result="Got 200 OK on admin endpoint",
      success=True,
      learning="Server accepts unsigned JWTs"
    )

  using_cookie_profiles: |
    # Use pre-configured auth sessions
    http_request(
      url="https://api.example.com/user",
      cookie_profile="admin_session"  # Loads from secure file
    )

  finding_similar_attacks: |
    # What worked before?
    find_similar_techniques(
      technique="SQL injection",
      success_only=True
    )

minimal_parameters:
  create_target:
    required: ["name", "base_url"]

  create_mission:
    required: ["target_id", "mission_type", "name", "goal"]

  http_request:
    required: ["url"]
    useful: ["method", "headers", "data", "cookie_profile"]

  record_action:
    required: ["mission_id", "technique"]
    important: ["learning"]  # This builds knowledge!

mission_types:
  prompt_injection: "AI/LLM manipulation"
  business_logic: "Application logic flaws"
  auth_bypass: "Authentication bypasses"
  api_discovery: "Hidden endpoints"
  data_exfiltration: "Information disclosure"

key_differences_from_v1:
  - "NO auto-target creation from URLs"
  - "Missions organize testing (was AiSession)"
  - "Actions record learning with vector search"
  - "Semantic search finds similar past work"

tips:
  - "Always record learning in actions"
  - "Use cookie_profile for auth sessions"
  - "Let vector search find patterns"
  - "Failed attempts are valuable data"
  - "User instructions override guides"
