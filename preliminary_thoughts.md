# Preliminary Thoughts - Red Team MCP Server Organization

## Overview
Multi-server MCP architecture for ethical penetration testing operations, organized by engagement phase and tool category.

## Server Organization Strategy

### 1. **HTTP Operations Server** (`src/code_mcp/servers/http/`)
**Purpose**: Raw HTTP manipulation and testing
- **Tools**:
  - Custom HTTP requests (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE with full header control)
  - Request/response inspection
  - Cookie management and session handling
  - Proxy support and request routing
- **Library**: httpx for async operations, requests for compatibility
- **Scope**: Individual request crafting, response analysis
- **Use Cases**:
  - Manual request manipulation
  - Authentication bypass testing
  - Header injection testing
  - Custom payload delivery

### 2. **Reconnaissance Server** (`src/code_mcp/servers/recon/`)
**Purpose**: Information gathering and enumeration
- **Tools**:
  - DNS enumeration and zone transfers
  - Subdomain discovery and brute forcing
  - Port scanning and service detection
  - SSL/TLS certificate analysis
  - WHOIS and domain intelligence
- **Integrations**: nmap, dig, whois, custom enumeration tools
- **Features**: Target profiling, service fingerprinting
- **Scope**: Passive and active reconnaissance

### 3. **Fuzzing/Intruder Server** (`src/code_mcp/servers/fuzzing/`)
**Purpose**: Automated testing and payload delivery (Burp Intruder equivalent)
- **Tools**:
  - Parameter fuzzing with custom wordlists
  - Directory and file brute forcing
  - Payload iteration and permutation
  - Response comparison and filtering
- **Features**:
  - Wordlist management and generation
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - Result filtering and analysis
  - Multi-threaded/async execution
- **Scope**: Burp Intruder-style functionality with custom logic

### 4. **Vulnerability Assessment Server** (`src/code_mcp/servers/vuln/`)
**Purpose**: Specific vulnerability testing and detection
- **Tools**:
  - SQL injection detection and exploitation
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) testing
  - Command injection testing
  - Local/remote file inclusion testing
  - XXE and deserialization testing
- **Features**:
  - Payload generation and customization
  - Response analysis and validation
  - False positive reduction
  - Vulnerability scoring and reporting
- **Scope**: Targeted vulnerability testing with intelligent payloads

### 5. **Post-Exploitation Server** (`src/code_mcp/servers/postex/`)
**Purpose**: Post-compromise activities and privilege escalation
- **Tools**:
  - System enumeration and information gathering
  - Privilege escalation checks (LinPEAS/WinPEAS equivalent)
  - Lateral movement assistance
  - Credential hunting and extraction
  - Persistence mechanism deployment
- **Features**:
  - OS-specific enumeration scripts
  - Network discovery and mapping
  - Service account analysis
  - File system traversal and search
- **Scope**: Post-access operations and environment mapping

## Implementation Advantages

### Security Benefits
- **Isolation**: Each server runs in its own context, limiting blast radius
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Servers only have access to their specific tools
- **Audit Trail**: Server-specific logging for compliance and reporting
- **Controlled Scope**: Easy to enable/disable specific capabilities per engagement

### Operational Benefits
- **Targeted Toolsets**: Claude gets focused tool sets per engagement phase
- **Flexible Deployment**: Run only needed servers per test scenario
- **Modular Testing**: Test specific attack vectors without full toolkit
- **Team Collaboration**: Different team members can work on different servers

### Technical Benefits
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows project's composition-over-inheritance pattern
- **Type Safety**: Full typing with protocols for all server interactions
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new servers or tools within existing servers
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities

```

## CLI Integration
- `code_mcp serve http` - Start HTTP operations server
- `code_mcp serve recon` - Start reconnaissance server
- `code_mcp serve fuzzing` - Start fuzzing server
- `code_mcp serve vuln` - Start vulnerability assessment server
- `code_mcp serve postex` - Start post-exploitation server
- `code_mcp serve all` - Start all servers (development mode)

## Security Considerations
- All operations are for authorized penetration testing only
- Built-in logging and audit trails for compliance
- Rate limiting and throttling to prevent accidental DoS
- Clear scoping and targeting controls
- Integration with engagement documentation and reporting

## Next Steps
1. Implement HTTP Operations Server first (immediate use case)
2. Add comprehensive HTTP request/response tools
3. Build out reconnaissance capabilities
4. Expand to other server types based on engagement needs
